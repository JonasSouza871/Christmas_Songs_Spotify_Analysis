    "Due to our limited dataset size of approximately 400 weekly observations (2017-2025), we selected Moving Average as a baseline benchmark and SARIMA as the primary forecasting model. LSTM and Prophet were excluded because LSTM requires thousands of data points to avoid overfitting and achieve reliable predictions, while Prophet is optimized for daily-granularity data with multiple seasonality levels that our weekly dataset cannot fully leverage. SARIMA provides the optimal balance for small-to-medium seasonal datasets, explicitly modeling trend and cyclical patterns while maintaining interpretability and computational efficiency.\n"
